/**
 * Creates an operation for implementors of the Spring MVC Controller
 * interface (pre annotated MVC).
 * 
 * This class does something slightly different than the other controller
 * methods. Since there are several base classes which implement Controller, and
 * we do not want to handle them all, we simply identify the class as the target 
 * class that is being invoked (not the class which contains the handleRequest method).
 * 
 * This means that the source code location may not actually point at the real file
 * which houses handleRequest, but should point at the user's code, which will have the
 * real handler implementation (albeit with a likely different name)
