 * <P><B>Note:</B> the basic assumption is that the {@link Repository} interface
 * (and its descendants) are used ONLY for spring-data proxy-ing. In other
 * words, if there is an actual class that implements this interface, then
 * <B><U>all</U></B> its methods will be intercepted and not only those that
 * are defined in an interface derived from the repository one.</P>
 * 
 * <P>It is possible to modify the aspect so as to intercept only methods
 * from interfaces derived from {@link Repository}, but this would be a
 * <B><U>runtime</U></B> filtering. In other words, we would need to use
 * reflection API to inspect each and every call in order to decide whether
 * to generate an intercepted {@link com.springsource.insight.intercept.operation.Operation}.
 * This seems very time-consuming and therefore for the initial version of
 * this aspect we will go with the basic assumption described above</P>
 *  
 * <B>Note(s)</B>:</BR>
 * <UL>
 *      <LI><P>
 *      We must use call since the proxy-ing mechanism does not always implement
 *      the methods but rather directly converts them to executed queries
 *      </P></LI></BR>
 * 
 *      <LI><P>
 *      We use the {@link RepositoryDefinition} annotation as well - even though
 *      the current implementation of spring-data-commons expects the annotated
 *      interface to be a {@link Repository} (which is intercepted anyway) - see
 *      {@link RepositoryFactoryBeanSupport#getObject()} automatic cast. We leave
 *      it in anyway in case this is fixed or some other factory bean is used that
 *      does not have this implicit assumption
 *      </P></LI></BR>
 *      
 *      <LI><P>
 *      We use <code>cflowbelow</code> since some implementations actually
 *      provide some generic implementation (e.g., SimpleJpaRepsitory), so the
 *      methods may also being invoked and we don't want double interception
 *      </P></LI></BR>
